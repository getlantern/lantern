  "readme": "= Faye\n\n* http://faye.jcoglan.com\n* http://groups.google.com/group/faye-users\n* http://github.com/faye/faye\n\nFaye is a set of tools for dirt-simple publish-subscribe messaging between web\nclients. It ships with easy-to-use message routing servers for Node.js and Rack\napplications, and clients that can be used on the server and in the browser.\n\nSee http://faye.jcoglan.com for documentation.\n\n\n== Questions, issues, ideas\n\nPlease raise questions on the mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/faye-users,\nand feel free to announce and share ideas on Faye-related projects here too. I'd\nappreciate it if we only use the GitHub issue tracker for bona fide bugs; You'll\nprobably get better and quicker answers to questions from the mailing list.\n\n\n== Development\n\nTo hack on Faye, you'll need Ruby in order to build both the Gem and the NPM\npackage. There are also a few submodules we use for testing. The following\nshould get you up and running:\n\n  # Download the code from Git\n  git clone git://github.com/faye/faye.git\n  cd faye\n  git submodule update --init --recursive\n  \n  # Install dependencies\n  bundle install\n  npm install\n  \n  # Build Faye\n  bundle exec jake\n  \n  # Run tests\n  bundle exec rspec -c spec/\n  node spec/node.js\n  \n  # Install Ruby gem\n  gem build faye.gemspec\n  gem install faye-x.x.x.gem\n  \n  # Install NPM package\n  npm install build\n\n\n== To-do\n\n* Provide reflection API for internal stats on channels, subscriptions, message queues\n* (Maybe) build a monitoring GUI into the server\n* Add sugar for authentication extensions for protected subscribe + publish\n* Provide support for user-defined <tt>/service/*</tt> channels\n* Let local server-side clients listen to <tt>/meta/*</tt> channels\n\n\n== License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2009-2012 James Coglan and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the\nSoftware, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
