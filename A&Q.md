# A:When I use Blue Light Pro in China, it always automatically switches to Korea (code: KR), which causing me to be unable to use chatGPT, what should I do? 
  * Would Blue Light consider adding the ability to manually select countries while retaining the automatic selection of proxy countries?  For example, add a button to turn off automatic selection and then manually select a proxy country from the countries listed; 
  * If not, would Blue Light consider adding a button to switch to other countries?  It is up to the user to decide whether to switch countries, but the blue light determines which country to switch to. For example, when the automatic agent country is KR, I can manually switch the blue light to another country that Blue light thinks is the best agent by clicking this button, but this country cannot be the country KR that has just been agent. 
  * Please give a professional answer to this question, thank you!
