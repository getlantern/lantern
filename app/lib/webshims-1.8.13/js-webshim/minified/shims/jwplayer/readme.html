	<h1>About the JW Player 5</h1>
	<p>Thank you for downloading the JW Player, the leading open source video player for Flash and HTML5 on the Web.  Not only is the JW Player the easiest way to put video on your website, but we offer a host of other products and services to assist in providing the best possible video experience for your users.</p>

	<h3>Quickstart</h3>
	<p>The quickest way to get started is to unzip the file you downloaded (you must have done that if you're reading this!) and copy the contents into a folder called 'jwplayer' at the root of your website.  The end result should be:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>{webroot}/jwplayer/player.swf</li>
	  <li>{webroot}/jwplayer/jwplayer.js</li>
	  <li>etc...</li>
	</ol>
    <p>You can then view the source of this page and copy the code from the example below onto your webpage.  That's it!  You should see a player on your site.</p>

	<h3>An Example of the JW Player</h3>
	<p>Below you see a simple embedded example of the JW Player.</p>

	<!-- START OF THE PLAYER EMBEDDING TO COPY-PASTE -->
	<div id="mediaplayer">JW Player goes here</div>
	
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jwplayer.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		jwplayer("mediaplayer").setup({
			flashplayer: "player.swf",
			file: "video.mp4",
			image: "preview.jpg"
		});
	</script>
	<!-- END OF THE PLAYER EMBEDDING -->
