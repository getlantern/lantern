# .gitignore file for Xcode4 and Xcode5 Source projects
#
# Apple bugs, waiting for Apple to fix/respond:
#
#    15564624 - what does the xccheckout file in Xcode5 do? Where's the documentation?
#
# Version 2.6
# For latest version, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects
#
# 2015 updates:
# - Fixed typo in "xccheckout" line - thanks to @lyck for pointing it out!
# - Fixed the .idea optional ignore. Thanks to @hashier for pointing this out
# - Finally added "xccheckout" to the ignore. Apple still refuses to answer support requests about this, but in practice it seems you should ignore it.
# - minor tweaks from Jona and Coeur (slightly more precise xc* filtering/names)
# 2014 updates:
# - appended non-standard items DISABLED by default (uncomment if you use those tools)
# - removed the edit that an SO.com moderator made without bothering to ask me
# - researched CocoaPods .lock more carefully, thanks to Gokhan Celiker
# 2013 updates:
# - fixed the broken "save personal Schemes"
# - added line-by-line explanations for EVERYTHING (some were missing)
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
# and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
# files that we want to exclude

# *.lock - this is used and abused by many editors for many different things.
#    For the main ones I use (e.g. Eclipse), it should be excluded 
#    from source-control, but YMMV.
#   (lock files are usually local-only file-synchronization on the local FS that should NOT go in git)
# c.f. the "OPTIONAL" section at bottom though, for tool-specific variations!
#
# In particular, if you're using CocoaPods, you'll want to comment-out this line:
*.lock


#

# Xcode build files -
#
# NB: slash on the end, so we only remove the FOLDER, not any files that were badly named "DerivedData"

DerivedData/

# NB: slash on the end, so we only remove the FOLDER, not any files that were badly named "build"

#####
# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

# .pbxuser: http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2004/Jan/msg00193.html

*.pbxuser

# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings
#
# Apple Shared data that Apple put in the wrong folder
# c.f. http://stackoverflow.com/a/19260712/153422
#     FROM ANSWER: Apple says "don't ignore it"
#     FROM COMMENTS: Apple is wrong; Apple code is too buggy to trust; there are no known negative side-effects to ignoring Apple's unofficial advice and instead doing the thing that actively fixes bugs in Xcode
# Up to you, but ... current advice: ignore it.
*.xccheckout

#
#
# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
#     throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
#     - unless they are "shared")
# As per build/ and DerivedData/, this ought to have a trailing slash
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 2 below
xcuserdata/

# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
#     get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
#     - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep
#
# NB: this *requires* git v1.8.2 or above; you may need to upgrade to latest OS X,
#    or manually install git over the top of the OS X version
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 1 above
#
#xcuserdata/**/*

#     (requires option 2 above): Personal Schemes
#
#!xcuserdata/**/xcschemes/*

####
# XCode 4 workspaces - more detailed
#
# Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)
#
# Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
#
# /(root)/
#   /(project-name).xcodeproj/
#     project.pbxproj
#     /project.xcworkspace/
#       contents.xcworkspacedata
#       /xcuserdata/
#         /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#           UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate
#     /xcshareddata/
#       /xcschemes/
#         (shared scheme name).xcscheme
#     /xcuserdata/
#       /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#         (private scheme).xcscheme
#         xcschememanagement.plist

# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!

*.moved-aside

####
# OPTIONAL: Some well-known tools that people use side-by-side with Xcode / iOS development
#
# NB: I'd rather not include these here, but gitignore's design is weak and doesn't allow
#     modular gitignore: you have to put EVERYTHING in one file.
