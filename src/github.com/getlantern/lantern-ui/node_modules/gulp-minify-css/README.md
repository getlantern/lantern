## Breaking Changes from v0.3 to v0.4 (due to clean-css)

* `noAdvanced` became `advanced` - make sure to reverse the value;
* `noAggressiveMerging` became `aggressiveMerging` - make sure to reverse the value;
* `noRebase` became `rebase` - make sure to reverse the value;

## Regarding Issues
This is just a simple gulp plugin, which means it's nothing more than a thin wrapper around `clean-css`. If it looks like you are having CSS related issues, please contact <a href="https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css">clean-css</a>. Only create a new issue if it looks like you're having a problem with the plugin itself.

## Information

<table>
<tr> 
<td>Package</td><td>gulp-minify-css</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Minify css with <a href="https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css">clean-css</a>, including optional caching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Node Version</td>
<td>>= 0.10</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Installion

```sh
npm install --save-dev gulp-minify-css
```

## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp'),
		minifyCSS = require('gulp-minify-css');

gulp.task('minify-css', function() {
  return gulp.src('./static/css/*.css')
    .pipe(minifyCSS({keepBreaks:true}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'))
});
```
### Options
* `cache` - check and return minified CSS from cache if it exists; minify and store in cache when it does not

This is a gulp-minify-css feature and not a [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css/) feature.

___


* `advanced` - set to false to disable advanced optimizations - selector & property merging, reduction, etc.
* `aggressiveMerging` - set to false to disable aggressive merging of properties.
* `benchmark` - turns on benchmarking mode measuring time spent on cleaning up (run `npm run bench` to see example)
* `compatibility` - enables compatibility mode, see [full README for more examples](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css/blob/master/README.md#how-to-set-compatibility-mode)
* `debug` - set to true to get minification statistics under `stats` property (see `test/custom-test.js` for examples)
* `inliner` - a hash of options for `@import` inliner, see test/protocol-imports-test.js for examples
* `keepBreaks` - whether to keep line breaks (default is false)
* `keepSpecialComments` - `*` for keeping all (default), `1` for keeping first one only, `0` for removing all
* `processImport` - whether to process `@import` rules
* `rebase` - set to false to skip URL rebasing
* `relativeTo` - path to __resolve__ relative `@import` rules and URLs
* `root` - path to __resolve__ absolute `@import` rules and __rebase__ relative URLs
* `roundingPrecision` - rounding precision; defaults to `2`; `-1` disables rounding
* `shorthandCompacting` - set to false to skip shorthand compacting (default is true unless sourceMap is set when it's false)

### Source maps
Source maps can be generated by using [gulp-sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sourcemaps):

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var minifyCSS = require('gulp-minify-css');
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.task('minify-css', function() {
  return gulp.src('./src/*.css')
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(minifyCSS())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```
#### Caveats

When minifying (and import inlining) files with existing source map, be aware clean-css doesn't yet support source maps with inline source (`sourcesContent` property).. See [#397](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css/issues/397).  As such ensure that incoming source maps have properly set `sourceRoot` and `soureces` values to map back to the original source files.
