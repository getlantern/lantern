Carousel creates a carousel similar to bootstrap's image carousel.

The carousel also offers support for touchscreen devices in the form of swiping. To enable swiping, load the `ngTouch` module as a dependency.

Use a `<carousel>` element with `<slide>` elements inside it.  It will automatically cycle through the slides at a given rate, and a current-index variable will be kept in sync with the currently visible slide.
