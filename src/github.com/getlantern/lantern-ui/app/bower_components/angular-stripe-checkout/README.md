angular-stripe-checkout
=======================

angular-stripe-checkout is a thin wrapper around Stripe Checkout that
adds a few useful features:

* Defers loading of checkout.js until needed
* Promisifies the handler object API
* Provides a version of the "simple integration" API that lets you
  control the appearance of the button, and provides the token object to
  a function of your choice

Check out the examples for more details.
