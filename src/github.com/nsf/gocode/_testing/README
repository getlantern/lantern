This is a bunch of automated tests for gocode.

Tests can be slow, because after each request gocode server runs GC.
And current Go GC is slow. You won't notice that other than in tests
because usually you spend some time in editor between requests and
that time is wasted on a GC run, but testing app throws requests one
after another and it causes GC to eat a lot of CPU. So.. don't worry
about that.
