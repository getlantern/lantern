First release: November 1 2011 
Updated November 8 2011:
 - Corrected PH social and Internet tools scores from 2 to 0
 - Corrected mismatch between MD's scores and textual description
 - Updated KR social score from 3 to 2 to reflect new test results


The OpenNet Initiative (ONI) uses a simple technical methodology to verify Internet 
censorship. In order to identify and document internet filtering, ONI checks two lists of 
websites in each of the countries tested: a global list (constant for each country) and a 
local list (different for each country). The global list is comprised of internationally 
relevant websites with provocative or objectionable content in English. The local lists 
are designed individually for each country to document unique filtering and blocking 
behavior. In countries where Internet censorship has been reported, the local lists also 
include those sites that were alleged to have been blocked. These lists are samples and 
are not meant to be exhaustive.

A data collection software client designed to query these pre-defined lists of URLs is 
distributed to researchers within countries suspected of engaging in Internet censorship. 
The list of URLs is accessed simultaneously over HTTP both in the country suspected 
of Internet filtering and a country with no filtering regime (e.g., Canada). The data 
gathered from the country with no filtering is used as a control to compare the data from 
the country suspected of filtering. Additional diagnostic work is performed to separate 
normal connectivity errors from intentional tampering.  Where appropriate, the tests are 
run from different national level Internet service provider connections in the country to 
capture the possible differences in blocking behavior across different ISPs and across 
multiple days and weeks to control for normal connectivity problems.  
The ONI publishes results from these tests in country profiles (see 
http://opennet.net/country-profiles). Each country profile includes the summary results of 
the empirical testing for filtering. The technical filtering data alone, however, do not 
amount to a complete picture of Internet censorship and content regulation. A wide 
range of policies relating to media, speech, and expression also act to restrict 
expression on the Internet and online community formation. Legal and regulatory 
frameworks, including Internet law, the state of Internet access and infrastructure, the 
level of economic development, and the quality of governance institutions are central to 
determining which countries resort to filtering and how they choose to implement 
Internet content controls. A brief overview of each of these factors is included in the 
each of the country profiles. Together, these sections are intended to offer a concise, 
accurate, and unbiased overview of Internet filtering and content regulation.  


Each country is given a score on a five-point scale. The scores reflect the observed level of 
filtering in each of four themes:

1.  Political: This category is focused primarily on Web sites that express views in 
opposition to those of the current government. Content more broadly related to 
human rights, freedom of expression, minority rights, and religious movements is 
also considered here. 
 
2.  Social: This group covers material related to sexuality, gambling, and illegal drugs 
and alcohol, as well as other topics that may be socially sensitive or perceived as 
offensive. 
 
3.  Conflict/security: Content related to armed conflicts, border disputes, separatist 
movements, and militant groups is included in this category. 
 
4.  Internet tools: Web sites that provide e-mail, Internet hosting, search, translation, 
Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone service, and circumvention methods 
are grouped in this category. 


The relative magnitude of filtering for each of the four themes is defined as follows: 

1.  Pervasive filtering (score of 4): Filtering that is characterized by both its depth—a 
blocking regime that blocks a large portion of the targeted content in a given 
category—and its breadth—a blocking regime that includes filtering in several 
categories in a given theme. 

2.   Substantial filtering (score of 3): Filtering that has either depth or breadth: either a 
number of categories are subject to a medium level of filtering or a low level of 
filtering is carried out across many categories. 

3.  Selective filtering (score of 2): Narrowly targeted filtering that blocks a small 
number of specific sites across a few categories or filtering that targets a single 
category or issue. 

4.  Suspected filtering (score of 1): Connectivity abnormalities are present that 
suggest the presence of filtering, although diagnostic work was unable to confirm 
conclusively that inaccessible websites are the result of deliberate tampering. 

5.  No evidence of filtering (score of 0): ONI testing did not uncover any evidence of 
websites being blocked.  


Through examination of both technical and contextual data the ONI derives a measure 
(low, medium, or high) of the observed transparency and consistency of blocking 
patterns. The transparency score given to each country is a qualitative measure based 
on the level at which the country openly engages in filtering. In cases where filtering 
takes place without open acknowledgment, or where the practice of filtering is actively 
disguised to appear as network errors, the transparency score is low. In assigning the 
transparency score, we have also considered the presence of provisions to appeal or 
report instances of inappropriate blocking. Consistency measures the variation in 
filtering within a country across different ISPs—in some cases the availability of specific 
Web pages differs significantly depending on the ISP one uses to connect to the 
Internet. 


About the OpenNet Initiative  

The OpenNet Initiative is a collaborative partnership of three institutions: the Citizen 
Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for 
Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group (Ottawa). 
Our aim is to investigate, expose and analyze Internet filtering and surveillance 
practices in a credible and non-partisan fashion. We intend to uncover the potential 
pitfalls and unintended consequences of these practices, and thus help to inform better 
public policy and advocacy work in this area. To achieve these aims, the ONI employs a 
unique multi-disciplinary approach that includes: 

-  Development and deployment of a suite of technical enumeration tools and core 
methodologies for the study of Internet filtering and surveillance; 

-  Capacity-building among networks of local advocates and researchers 

-  Advanced studies exploring the consequences of current and future trends and 
trajectories in filtering and surveillance practices, and their implications for 
domestic and international law and governance regimes.
