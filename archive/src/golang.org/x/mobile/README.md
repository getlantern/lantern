# Go support for Mobile devices

The Go mobile repository holds packages and build tools for using Go on mobile platforms.

Package documentation as a starting point:

- [Building all-Go apps](https://golang.org/x/mobile/app)
- [Building libraries for SDK apps](https://golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gobind)

![Caution image](doc/caution.png)

The Go Mobile project is experimental. Use this at your own risk.
While we are working hard to improve it, neither Google nor the Go
team can provide end-user support.

This is early work and installing the build system requires Go 1.5.
Follow the instructions on
[golang.org/wiki/Mobile](https://golang.org/wiki/Mobile)
to install the gomobile command, build the
[basic](https://golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic)
and the [bind](https://golang.org/x/mobile/example/bind) example apps.
