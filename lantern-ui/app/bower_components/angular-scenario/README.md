# packaged angular-scenario

This tool is now in maintenance mode. If you are starting a new project, please use
[Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor). Existing projects using scenario runner are
advised to migrate to protractor, as this tool is unlikely to receive updates.

This repo is for distribution on `npm` and `bower`. The source for this module is in the
[main AngularJS repo](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/src/ngScenario).
Please file issues and pull requests against that repo.
